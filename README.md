# API_Design-Node-js-

A full-stack project demonstrating best practices in API design, featuring a Node.js/TypeScript backend and a modern frontend built with Vite and TypeScript.

---


## Features

- RESTful API design with modular structure
- TypeScript throughout (frontend & backend)
- Clear separation of concerns (handlers, routes, utils)
- Environment-based configuration for flexibility and security
- Example CRUD endpoints (see `handlers/`)
- Ready for unit testing (Vitest)
- Linting and code quality tools

---

## Example API Endpoints

- `GET /api/review` — Get all reviews
- `POST /api/user` — Create a new user
- ...more in `src/handlers/` and `src/router/`.

## How to Test the Project

### Backend

The backend uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit/integration testing.

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

2. **Configure environment variables** if needed (testing may require a special `.env.test`).

3. **Run the test suite**:
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
    or, if no test script is defined, use:
    ```bash
    npx vitest
    ```

- Tests are typically located alongside source files or in a `__tests__` directory.
- Check test output for passing/failing tests and coverage.

### Frontend

If frontend tests are set up (commonly with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), or similar):

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the test suite**:
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
    or, if not set up, add tests to `src/` and configure a test runner.
